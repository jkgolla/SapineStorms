## Supporting model resources for 'Antecedent hydrologic conditions reflected in stream lithium isotope ratios during storms'

This upload implements an update to the CrunchTope reactive transport software to enable time-variable flow rate. This new capability is used to simulate observed storm events. The contents include model files and a Jupyter notebook used to read in model results. The models were run with PETSc 3.7.7 (https://petsc.org/release/).
